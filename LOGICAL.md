# What is a "Logical Language"? #

### What do we mean by "logical"? ###

- Logic must be consistent

- Logic must not be ambiguous

- Logic requires clarity

- Logic is universal

- Logic is unbiased

### What properties must a logical language have? ###

- To be a usable language, written and spoken

- Every grammatical uterance has a unique and correct parse (syntactically unambiguous)

- This parse maps directly to a unique formula of symbolic logic

### Functional properties a logical language should have? ###

- Simple concepts should be simple to express

- Complex concepts should be able to be expressed precisely, at the cost of verbosity.

- Concepts should be expressable both vaguely or precisely.
  We don't want a minimal or maximal limit on precision of expression.

- Minimize Semantic Ambiguity.

- Minimize unnecessary complexity. "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

### Clarifications ###

- Ambiguousness is multiple possible distinct/unrelated meanings.
  Vagueness is a single meaning, expressed with less precision.
  Vagueness is acceptable, if it can optionally be overcome by the speaker.

- Some people may advocate being "rational" over "logical".
  The term "rational" is not used in the goal statement with the view that; logical thought is required to evaluate and choose rational actions.

- Language is used for several modes of communication:

  - Directly between people (conversation)
  
  - Internal to one person (thought)
  
  - Via storage medium (written)
